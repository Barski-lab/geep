1. Create class which will hold the map, where
	key - isoform id
	value - sorted list of annotation from the same isoform
2. Put there map for saving results (the same as we have now iso_map)
3. In class after adding of each annotation pointer check if it is equal to pointer that is next for current isoform
	You need to save previous iterators for each of the isoform and on the base of this compare current
	annotation pointer with the following in the sorted list
4. When the current annotation pointer is not the following in the list for its isoform, we don't put it in iso_map

THIS IS THE BASIC IDEA HOW TO MAKE CHECK IF TWO OR MORE ANNOTATION FROM THE SAME ISOFORM FOLLOWS EACH OTHER WITHOUT SPACES
